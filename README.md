# Day-Planner
I am used a daily planner to create a schedule
It's current day is displayed at the top of thcalendar
I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
I can enter an even click into a timeblock.
Text for that event is saved in local storage
aved events persist
